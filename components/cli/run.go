// Run provides the common boilerplate code around executing a cobra command.
// For example, it ensures that logging is set up properly. Logging
// flags get added to the command line if not added already. Flags get normalized
// so that help texts show them with hyphens. Underscores are accepted
// as alternative for the command parameters.
//
// Run tries to be smart about how to print errors that are returned by the
// command: before logging is known to be set up, it prints them as plain text
// to stderr. This covers command line flag parse errors and unknown commands.
// Afterwards it logs them. This covers runtime errors.
//
// Commands like kubectl where logging is not normally part of the runtime output
// should use RunNoErrOutput instead and deal with the returned error themselves.

	//
	// The recommendation from #sig-cli was to print the usage text, then
	// the error. We implement this consistently for all commands here.
	// However, we don't want to print the usage text when command
	// execution fails for other reasons than parsing. We detect this via
	// the FlagParseError callback.
